Project using Spring boot and node server to run the client.

### Client

At first do you need install all node dependencies and run the server

    `cd client`
    `npm install`
    `np start` 

After the client is running you can access your `localhost:9090`


### Server

At first you need install all maven dependencies to run I recommend you use your Java IDE and run the serve, the server is going to run in `localhost:8080`
